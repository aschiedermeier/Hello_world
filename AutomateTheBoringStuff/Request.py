### example of unsuccessful download

# get page
res = requests.get('http://inventwithpython.com/page_that_does_not_exist')

# check if it's ok
print(res.status_code == requests.codes.ok)
print(res.status_code) # 400 is not ok
print(requests.codes.ok) # 200 is ok

# Always call raise_for_status() after calling requests.get(). 
# You want to be sure that the download has actually worked before your program continues.
try:
    res.raise_for_status()
except Exception as exc:
    print('There was a problem: %s' % (exc))
